title: Unit Testing Resources
---
I was asked by a coworker for a few resources around unit testing in Ruby and figured I should collect them here rather than have to find them the next time someone asks me for them.

Here's a quick [post by Thoughtbot][thoughtbot-tdd] that gives newbies the basics of TDD.

IMO [this article by Leigh Halliday][unit-testing] goes in-depth a bit more into how to write good unit tests. That post also happens to link to this [post by DHH][dhh-on-tdd] which I feel brings up good points about following any doctrine without exception. 

Here's a fun talk from the creator of Minitest about [Minitest 5 and what to expect from MT6][mt6].

And here is a talk I went to see at RubyConf2017 about how to evaluate tests called [High Cost Tests and High Value Tests][test-value].

I'm sure these will come in handy to explain to folks in the future...
