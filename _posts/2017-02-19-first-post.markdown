Ah, the first post of a new blog. FINALLY.

I've been meaning to start this for weeks now and just found it hard to sit
down and write - not to mention the endless internal debate of what platform to
use... So here, have a Jekyll blog with a single post in it.

A think lot of people get really hung up on having a focus for their blog and
I've definitely found myself narrowing my vision in the past, but this time is
different. I decided that the "topic" for my blog would be: "things I find
interesting." This really isn't for other people, though I intend to share links
to some of my posts via other channels. This blog is for me. I think it's
helpful to write that down for myself as a reminder. :)

Now, off to the writing!
